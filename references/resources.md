*Mark D* on DMCTalk:

> The digital speedo box is made from Hammond enclosure PN 1591CGY. 

> The original was actually blue so production painted it white. The gray enclosure is close in color that you wouldn't need to paint it or you can still paint it satin white. The connector on the back is a D-sub type connector like you'd find on an old printer cable. There are various types you can buy on Newark.com, mouser.com, etc that are close, I don't have a source for any that are identical to the screen used connector.

> The digital displays were originally made by Stanley Readout and are basically extinct at this point since they're ancient technology. Most people use 7 segment LED displays that look pretty accurate if you put a sheet of acetate film over the displays to act as a diffuser. I made a speedo a long time ago and used 1/16" styrene sheet to build the little black frame around each digit. The black border is part of the Stanley Readout on the real car, but you can make a close approximation of the real thing with polystyrene around an LED display and paint it black.

> Here's a CAD model of how the original was constructed showing the Stanley Readout housings. If you're going for super accuracy people have made plastic castings of the stanley bodies and then made matching circuit boards with grain of wheat size incadecent bulbs or warm LED's. It also requires manufacturing a clear lens and as well.

> The speedo was originally 3 digits and would read XX.X Apparently the third 1/10 MPH digit made reading the display confusing so production put a piece of black gaffer's tape over the 3rd digit so you only see XX. 

> 1. The original box had areas where the paint was scratched through and you could see the blue plastic below. The paint was an off white/light gray color.

> 2. The digits should sit flush with the outside of the case.

> 3. Only a couple of Stanley readout displays have ever been found. The couple that still exist actually came from one of the production crew members that still had them from when the screen used cars were built. The bulbs are incandescent and run hot, so small LEDs are usually a better choice when making replicas. I don't have a ready source available for buying castings of the stanley housings. There is also a clear lens that clips over the black plastic housing that needs to be cast or cut from sheets of clear plastic and glued together. Making a mold for casting is difficult due to the shape and depth of the recesses in the part. The black housings may be a good candidate for 3D printing rather than molding. Creating reproduction circuit boards are also a complicating factor.  
> A simpler solution is to use a readily available 7 segment LED displays and add plastic housings cut from sheet polystyrene to make them look more like the Stanley displays.

> 4. The diffuser is a sheet of matte acetate, can be found at craft stores, amazon, staples, office max, etc.

> 5. The TCD labels were originally made with a special type of label maker and required black and red tape that would print white. Finding a vintage label maker and the correct size tape is probably not going to be viable option.  
> A much better solution is to have custom vinyl decals printed and then cut them out to size. The Month, Day, Year, Hour, Min labels are .218" tall, the Destination Time, Present Time and Last Time Departed labels are .281" tall, and the AM PM labels are .188 tall. The labels were originally trimmed by hand to fit and are not all perfectly square or exactly the same height. The font is Microgramma Bold Extended

> 6. The digital speedo was originally built with three digits and would have read 88.0 when the car hits 88 mph. This presumably proved to be difficult to read on screen and looked like "880" so production covered the tenths digit with a piece of black gaffer's tape.

> The actual machine is a Kroy Model 80 label printer. It's 80's tech that's long since become obsolete so finding a working machine and the special printing tape in the right colors is an expensive (and time consuming) way to go. You also have to find the correct font printing wheel. A much better option is to print on vinyl and cut to size.
